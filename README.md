Integrating the Gemini Api was a very challenging Task and providing multilingual support in the chatbot was also a quite difficult task in the development of project in 24 hours span in Hackathon.

# Future Scope
We will develop the Verification of Facts stated in the video which is currently under progress. We will add the verification of video where user can check the correctness of facts given in the video by our developed model.
